INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

TO: Sergeant Jeffrey McDaniel #35716

FROM: Acting Captain Greg Pashley
Internal Affairs, Professional Standards Division

SUBJECT: Notice of Findings Stage for IA or IPR Investigation

RE: TA/IPR Case Number: 2021-B-0034
Complainant: Portland Police Bureau

This memo is to notify you that IA has completed the investigation into the listed complaint. The case
will soon be sent to your RU Manager for findings. Once completed, your RU Manager’s findings will
be reviewed by your Assistant Chief, myself, and a manager from the Independent Police Review (IPR).
If any of the reviewers disagree with your RU Manager’s findings, or if there are sustained findings with
proposed discipline greater than a letter of reprimand, the case will go before a Police Review Board
(PRB). In those cases, the PRB will review the investigation and make a recommendation to the Chief of
Police as to what the findings should be. Furthermore, if the PRB recommends any sustained findings,
they will also recommend discipline to the Chief.

You will be notified again once the findings are completed. In cases without PRBs, this process typically
takes about a month. If a PRB is necessary, you will be notified of that and will have an opportunity to
speak at the PRB. If you have any questions, please call Internal Affairs at (503) 823-0236.
